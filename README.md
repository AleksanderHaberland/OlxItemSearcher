## About The Project


The project enables process automation of finding certain goods from the OLX marketplace. The main result is generated announcements.xslx file, combining announcement title, URL address and price, in increasing order by price.

What are the needs to automate this process?

* Modern marketplaces often mix results without proper filtering, prioritizing announcements with purchased advert packages on the first pages.
* Browsing through many pages takes a lot of time while viewing listed elements in Excel is much faster.
* Excel elements may be used to develop your own BI ideas.



## Built With

Backend - VB.NET <br>
